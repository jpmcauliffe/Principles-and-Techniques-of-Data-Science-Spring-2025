It will cause errors when we run the autograder, and it will sometimes cause a failure to generate the PDF file.\n",

Our autograder isn't smart enough to check, but you're depriving yourself of key learning objectives if you write loops or comprehensions, and you also won't be ready for the midterm.\n",

    "Rather than the type you discovered in Part 1, we want each entry in `pd.TimeStamp` format. You might expect that the usual way to convert something from its current type to `TimeStamp` would be to use `astype`. You can do that, but the more typical way is to use `pd.to_datetime` (documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_datetime.html)). Using `pd.to_datetime`, create a new `ins['timestamp']` column containing `pd.Timestamp` objects. These will allow us to do date manipulation with much greater ease in parts III and IV. \n",

To resolve this, consider using the following string to specify the `format`: `'%m/%d/%Y %I:%M:%S %p'`. This particular format specifies that we would like our `pd.TimeStamp`s in the form `Month`/`Day`/`Year` `Hour`(12-hr)/`Minute`/`Second` `AM/PM`"

    "[Benford’s Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford%27s_law), also known as the Law of Anomalous Numbers or the First Digit Law, is a phenomenon seen in many real-world datasets. In datasets where Benford’s Law applies, there is an overrepresentation of small numbers (e.g., 1 and 2) in the leading digits of numeric entries and an underrepresentation of large numbers (e.g., 8 and 9). Benford’s Law is observed in river lengths, national populations, and has even been used to investigate [financial fraud](https://www.acfe.com/acfe-insights-blog/blog-detail?s=what-is-benfords-law-and-why-fraud-examiners-use-it)! More about Benford’s Law can be found [here](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-benfords-law-why-this-unexpected-pattern-of-numbers-is-everywhere/).\n",
